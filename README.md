# Statistical Arbitrage
Research, thoughts, and algorithms I've gathered on my exploration of applying statistical learning within financial markets.

If you're new to stat arb, I'd reccomend starting by reading the Avelladena paper in the "papers" directory -- it's kind of like the "Hello World" of this field. Use Wikipedia liberally (have a firm understanding of the linear regression model and how one could use such a model to decompose an asset's returns into SYSTEMATIC and IDIOSYNCRATIC returns).
