"""
Based on paper by Avellaneda and Lee.
Long-short based on PCA-derived risk factors.
author: Nathan Mugerwa

To improve: Try different learning models, de-"black box" the PCA process and try
different factor derivation processes (i.e. etfs), **create a more intelligent model,
and more!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Errors:

I. MODEL DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR TAIL EVENTS (Remember 2008?)
It does not check WHY a stock's idiosyncratic residual is so high. For example, a
stock that announces bankruptcy and drops by 99% in a day would be treated as extremely
cheap and bought up by this algorithm.

II. MODEL MAKES VERY STRONG ASSUMPTIONS
Returns fluctuation is a stationary process, mean-reverting, ... My time as
a discretionary trader makes me confident in eliminating lots of these assumptions
in different iterations of the algorithm. Too theoretical.

III. MODEL PERFORMS BADLY OUT-OF-SAMPLE
Bootstrapping? Hmm... Needs more thought.
